    Like with AirBNB, create a community/network of recent or next-to-be relocated individuals and family,
    From adventurers looking for the best place to live or work to people that just want to understand the place of their new job,
    the goal is to put together people with experience of relocation and new relocated that might become themselves coach after their own move. 
    There are a lot of websites and information on the web about relocation but a lot are simply advertizing of real estate agents or moving companies. 
    Finding people really understanding the local environment is always a challenge when you arrive in a new area, especialy if you coe from abroad.

    Why? because their interests are not convergent and their knowledge/personal experience is distant or has nothing to do with actual relocation.
